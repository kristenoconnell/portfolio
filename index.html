<div class="about-me">
<p>Hailing from humble Plano, Texas, I am currently studying to be a software engineer with Thinkful. I love solving problems and am excited for the real-world applications of learning software development!</p>

<p>After graduating from the University of Denver with a degree in Psychology, I spent several years exploring adulthood before I decided it was time for a career change. I've always loved figuring out the "why" behind how things work - turns out, that passion easily flows from learning how <i>humans</i> think into understanding how <i>computers</i> think. Outside of coding, I love practicing yoga, being outside, reading, and hanging out with my 3 year old lab.</p>

<p>At Thinkful, I've just begun to dip my toes into:</p>
<!-- Ordered list -->
  <ol>
    <li>JS</li>
    <li>HTML & CSS</li>
  </ol>
  <p>and I have many more exciting things coming up. I'm always in the market for new knowledge, a mentor, or another new-to-coding buddy! Please feel free to reach out to me through one of the links below.</p>

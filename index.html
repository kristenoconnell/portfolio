<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>After graduating college with a degree in Psychology and spending several years as a server, I decided it was time for a career change. I've always loved solving problems and figuring out the "why" behind how things work - turns out, that passion easily flows from learning how <i>humans</i> think into understanding how <i>computers</i> think.</p>

<p>Coding often involves problem-solving at the smallest level - sometimes down to a single line of code. But the programs we create have the ability to revolutionize technology and the way we live our daily lives. I'm so grateful for the chance to be a part of something that truly changes the world.</p>

<p>At Thinkful, I've just begun to dip my toes into JS, HTML, and CSS, and I have many more exciting things coming up. I'm always in the market for new knowledge, a mentor, friend, or another new-to-coding buddy! Please feel free to reach out to me through one of the links below.</p>

# Kristen O'Connell's Portfolio

In this file, you will find the portfolio of a passionate and committed junior software developer. 
It may be lean in content and style now, but have confidence that as my development as a developer progresses, this page will become more and more robust, interactive, and dynamic. 

For now, you will find: a favorite portrait; a little bit about me; an introduction to the stacks I've learned so far; and my contact information in multiple forms.

Stay tuned for more updates as my developer education continues!

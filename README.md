# Kristen O'Connell's Portfolio

In this file, you will find the portfolio of a brand-new aspiring software developer. 
It may be lean in content and style now, but have confidence that as the program progresses, this page will become more and more robust, interactive, and dynamic. 

For now, you will find: a favorite portrait; a little bit about me; an introduction to the things I've learned so far; and my contact information in multiple forms.

Stay tuned for more updates as my developer education continues!
